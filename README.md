openGL-CUDA-interop
===================

A first attempt at an openGL-CUDA program

I will be trying to write a basic program to explore the openGL API and how it can work with CUDA. 
This will be intially written for Linux (specifically Ubuntu 12.##) however there maybe be scope to 
extend it to other OS's.
